									<p>Mike believed he could outsmart the market by buying crypto and then selling when it moved a few cents higher.
									</p>

									<p>He bought 100 units ‚ÄúCoin‚Äù for $20 each and waited. When the price jumped to $20.05 Mike sold all, failing to realize that the sell price for ‚ÄúCoin‚Äù was $19.05. He lost precisely $100 in his first trading day.</p>

									<p>He was excited to start but didn‚Äôt know that the buy price is always a bit higher than the sell price.</p>

									<p>The price had move at least 5.5% to cover the spread and his strategy to work.</p>

									<p>Buy Price - $20 + 5.5% =  $21.1    </p>

									<p>Sell Price - $19 + 5.5% = $20.1</p>

									<p>In Mike‚Äôs defense ‚ÄúCoin‚Äù was a very volatile asset with a wide spread, had he payed attention he could have adjusted his strategy and expectations. </p>

							<p>Don‚Äôt worry when you see a new trade showing an immediate loss. Thats the spread cost which is covered as the price moves.          This actually makes trading safer, and cheating in the markets impossible.</p>

							<p><b>Different assets will have varying spreads based on two factors:</b></p>

							<p><b>Liquidity</b> enables you to quickly buy or sell an asset without causing major changes to the price. The higher the liquidity of an asset, the lower the spread and risk of price swings. </p>

							<p><b>Volatility</b> measures how rapidly the price changes. For example crypto assets are much more volatile than forex pairs therefore they tend to have wider spreads. Bitcoin can easily jump 10% in a day while EUR/USD usually needs weeks for such gains. </p>

							<p>The next chapter will offer three principles that will make it easier for you to understand what to trade.</p>
