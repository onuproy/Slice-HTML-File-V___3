						<p><b>Traders</b><i style="font-weight: 300;"> try to “time the market”,</i><br> <b>Investors</b> <i style="font-weight: 300;">prefer “time in the market”.</i></p>
						<p>You’re about to learn 2 long-term investing strategies  that have made a fortune for the greatest investor known to man: <b> Warren Buffet.</b></p>

						<h6><u>Dollar Cost Averaging(DCA)</u></h6>
						<div class="image">
							<img src="assets/images/vactor/dollar-cost.png" alt="Image">
						</div>
						<p>This strategy aims to minimize the time you must spend to check on your portfolio. You’re investing the same amount of money in the same asset at regular intervals.</p>
						<p>Ignore the fluctuations in the price Whether it's up or down, you stick to the plan.</p>
						<p>By doing this you are buying the asset in good times as well as bad times.</p>
						<p style="font-weight: 300;">✅<i> - In a bull market, the value of your asset increases. </i></p>
						<p style="font-weight: 300;">✅<i> -  In bear markets you get more of it for your money. </i></p>
						<div class="image">

						</div>
						<p style="font-weight: 300;"><i>Investors build enormous wealth with long-term regular investments in stock market indices like the <b>S&P500</b>, which have historically increased in value despite temporary ups and downs in the market.</i></p>
						<p>It’s important that you do your research carefully and thoroughly when choosing to dollar-cost average. If turns out to be a bad pick, you will just steadily invest your money into a sinking-ship.❗️</p>
					</div>
					<div class="content">
						<h6><u>Buy and Hold</u></h6>
						<p>This strategy is suited for those who  have a sharp eye for predicting what’s going to be popular, valuable and in demand. </p>
						<div class="image">
							<img src="assets/images/vactor/hold.png" alt="Image">
						</div>
						<p style="font-weight: 300;"><i>Some early investors back in 2011 saw the potential in Bitcoin, while others were skeptical.They turned a $1000 investment into well over $200 million just 10 years later by just buying and holding.</i></p>
						<p>A more “active” investor may use DCA to invest for a set period of time and make a profit, whereas a buy and hold investor is going to pick under-appreciated assets that have a high likelihood growing over a multi-year period. Mostly <b>crypto-assets, stocks and indices</b>.</p>
						<p>Like with any long-term financial decision it’s worth considering the worst-case scenario. In other words, what are the conditions under which you will stop holding or stop investing regularily. </p>

										<p>Albert Einstein once said: </p>
										<p>“Compound interest is the eighth wonder of the world. He who understands it, earns it; he who doesn't, pays it”.</p>
										<p>What he was really saying is that investors who <b>start early</b>, and <b>reinvest</b> their profits will see a magical snowballing effect which can truly make you wealthy.</p>
										<p><b>Here’s an example using the historical stock market return rate👇:</b></p>
										<p style="font-weight: 300;"><i>Let’s say your $5000 investment in a stock market index returns 8% this year, you have $5400 in total. Next year, your investment grows to 5832 and the year after to almost $6300. That’s because you’re earning interest on your interest, and that is the power of compounding. The earlier you start the bigger your future wealth will be.</i></p>
